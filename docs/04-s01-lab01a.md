**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Findings within the literature have been inconclusive regarding the differences in stigma and attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help between student-athletes and non-athlete students. Furthermore, although the type of sport (physical contact sport vs. physical non-contact sport) in which student-athletes compete might influence their levels of stigma, there is a lack of research further exploring its influence on their stigma levels and overall attitudes, and examining the differences in relation to these variables between student-athletes and their non-athlete peers while taking into account the type of sport. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the differences in public stigma, self-stigma and attitudes towards psychological help-seeking between student-athletes involved in physical contact sports, those involved in non-contact sports and non-athletes. Multiple One-way Between-subjects ANOVAs were conducted, with an ANOVA being performed per dependent variable (public stigma, self-stigma and attitudes). Contrary to what was hypothesised, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups of interest in public stigma, self-stigma and attitudes. These findings are interpreted and discussed in relation to previous research and several methodological limitations of the study, alongside with its potential implications and suggestions for further research.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Psychosis is a ubiquitous and functionally disruptive symptom of many psychiatric disorders. Research has explored the neuroanatomical correlates in the human subcortex that may be a risk factor for developing psychosis. There are two hypotheses, these are the neurodevelopmental hypothesis which assumes psychosis is static and is acquired from brain defects during development that do not change after the onset of psychosis, and the neurodegenerative hypothesis assumes psychosis is progressive and that areas of the brain continue to alter after the onset of psychosis. However, the precise roles of these neuroanatomical correlates in the human subcortex during psychosis are unclear. Here we establish whether there is already a difference in subcortical neuroanatomical structures when comparing clinical high-risk patients with healthy controls. We found a significant finding for reduced hippocampal volume between first-episode psychosis (FEP's) patients between healthy controls (CONS). No other significant findings for changes to any subcortical volumes were reported. Our results demonstrate support for the neurodegenerative hypothesis, as no differences in any of the subcortical structures were found before the onset of psychosis. We anticipate that these findings will strengthen the theoretical basis regarding the ongoing neurodevelopmental vs neurodegenerative debate and provide more robust evidence that reduced hippocampus volumes are a marker of illness and not a precursor. The implications of these results will help improve treatment recommendations and prognosis of any illnesses that involve psychosis.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Relatively little is known about why victims of childhood sexual abuse may be blamed for their abuse, despite the wealth of research on attributions of blame toward adult victims of sexual assault. Yet, responses to disclosure of childhood sexual abuse are instrumental in the child's subsequent processing strategies and so responses need to be supportive and free from blame to assist the child in reaching the best outcomes. This study examines the influence of Just World beliefs, gender, personal gender attribution, attitudes toward gay men, and gender role beliefs on judgements of victim culpability. Attitudes of the general population were assessed using a vignette which described the sexual assault of a gay, male, adolescent victim by a male perpetrator, followed by questionnaires. A generalised linear model was performed, and no support was found for an association between the predictor variables and victim blame. Overall, low levels of blame were found, with a significant tendency for participants not to attribute blame. However, a small number of participants indicated some degree of victim blame, demonstrating the need for continued research and attention. Explanations for the results are discussed alongside limitations of the study and theoretical and practical implications.

**Abstract:** Research indicates that mental health and well-being issues in the general population are on the rise during the pandemic, thus it is crucial that the public are then seeking treatment such as counselling.  With this in mind, the current study aimed to explore preferences for a counselling method, whether this is online or face-to-face counselling, during the pandemic. The study also attempted to address how age and counselling seeking behaviour before the pandemic affects preference as this subject remains understudied. This topic was analysed through a multiple regression which revealed nonsignificant findings between counselling seeking behaviour before the pandemic, and age, on counselling preference during the pandemic. The findings have generated the potential for further research opportunities, and these are discussed along with deliberations regarding the study's methodology.

**Abstract:** An emerging body of evidence suggests that trichotillomania may be maintained by differences in sensory processes. Utilising a quantitatively-driven embedded correlational concurrent mixed methods design, we investigated sensory features as a potential trigger for hairpulling. It was hypothesised that there would be a significantly positive association between hairpulling and sensory features. To assess our hypothesis, an opportunistically-recruited sample of adults (N = 48) completed the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HS) and the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ), with 41 participants opting to answer three open-ended questions about sensory features and trichotillomania. The GSQ as a measure of sensory features allowed for investigation of sensory features as a transdiagnostic construct characterising multiple conditions. A Spearman's correlation revealed no evidence that hairpulling, as measured by MGH-HS, and sensory features, as measured by GSQ, were significantly related (r~s~(46) = .15, p = .30, 95% CI [-.13, .40]). Thematic analysis of qualitative responses led to the development of four main themes: auditory sensitivity and self-soothing; tactile sensitivity and stimulation; need for control; and affective triggers. Integration of these findings drove five additional post-hoc correlational analyses between MGH-HS scores and GSQ scores in the auditory hypersensitivity (r~s~(46) = .26, p = .08, 95% CI [-.01, .49]), auditory hyposensitivity (r~s~(46) = .13, p = .36, 95% CI [-.15, .40]), tactile hypersensitivity (r~s~(46) = .08, p = .57, 95% CI [-.22, .38]), tactile hyposensitivity (r~s~(46) = .17, p = .26, 95% CI [-.14, .45]), and vestibular hypersensitivity (r~s~(46) = .22, p = .14, 95% CI [-.06, .49]) modalities. The current findings implicate a range of triggers in the maintenance of trichotillomania, particularly TTM-specific sensory features and emotional processes. Implications of these results for current theories of trichotillomania as well as its assessment and treatment were discussed.
